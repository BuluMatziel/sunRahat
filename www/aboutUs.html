                SunRahat has developed from Laurea-University of Applied Sciences business idea project. Laureas student Tarja had an idea to help people with finacial management issues from based on personal experiences. Just imagine, if there was a one service where you can get help and advices in any situation, regardless from your basis.<br /><br />
                If SunRahat doesn’t give the help you need, you get personal assistance with finding the help you need. Far too often people stay alone with their problems, because talking about money is a tabu as long as things are not out of control. SunRahat helps you personally to visualize your own bounds with your finances.
